# KF5042AudioForensicsProject

SoundAnalysis.mlx = This is the code used to analyse a single audio file of training data that was provided in the data set. I used this to visualise some of the data within the sound and the results (Graph, Periodogram, Histogram) are found and further expanded upon within the results analysis section of the paper. 

Classification.m = This code contains the experimental code, including the generation of multiple types of noise, the training of a Classification AI to distuingish between these types of noise, as well as the testing code to see how successful the AI is at classifying the various kinds of sound. To visualise some of the data we are working with and experiments taking place, the file also contains code that plots figures that presents information regarding the project.
